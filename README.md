# Crèche Management System 

 

##  Project Overview 

The **Crèche Management System** is a mobile application developed using **Android Studio (Kotlin)** and powered by **Google Firebase** and **PayFast**.   

It provides an efficient digital platform for crèche administrators and parents to manage attendance, payments, communication, and events — all in one secure, user-friendly system.

### **User Authentication** 

- Implemented **Firebase Authentication** for secure user sign-in and sign-out. 

- Ensures that both **Administrators** and **Parents** are verified before accessing the system. 

- Admin registers both the parent and child, providing login credentials. 

- Manages **token-based authentication** for session security and data privacy. 

- Provides personalized dashboards for each user type.

### **Attendance Tracking** 

- Developed a digital **Attendance Tracking System** using **Firebase Firestore**. 

- Replaces manual registers with real-time attendance updates. 

- Attendance tracked by subject: 

  - Mathematics 

  - English 

  - Natural Science 

  - Physical Education (PE) 

  - Life Orientation 

- Admin can mark attendance; parents can view attendance summaries. 

- Data is stored securely and synchronized across devices.

### **Messaging System** 

- Created a **Two-Way Messaging System** using **Firebase Firestore**. 

- Enables instant, structured communication between parents and administrators. 

- Features include: 

  - Real-time chat synchronization. 

  - Message timestamps and sender metadata. 

  - Secure storage of chat threads per user. 

- Provides an intuitive interface for both Admins and Parents to send/receive messages.

### **Payments (PayFast Integration)** 

- Integrated **PayFast**, a secure South African payment gateway. 

- Parents can make payments for tuition and events using debit or credit cards. 

- Transaction details are recorded on PayFast’s platform. 

- Admin verifies payments and updates the app’s payment status. 

- Generates **receipts** as proof of payment for parents.

### **Events Page** 

- Designed an **Events Page** to keep parents informed of upcoming crèche activities. 

- Displays organized event details (title, description, date, time, location). 

- Allows parents to **save events to their personal calendar** (Google/Apple). 

- Powered by **Firebase Firestore**, ensuring real-time updates. 

- Focuses on simplicity, accessibility, and parent engagement.

### **System Architecture** 

- Developed the **System Architecture** integrating multiple technologies: 

  - **Firebase Authentication** – Manages user access. 

  - **Firebase Firestore** – Stores structured data (profiles, attendance, events). 

  - **Firebase Realtime Database** – Powers real-time messaging. 

  - **PayFast Integration** – Handles payment transactions securely. 

- The Android front-end communicates with Firebase via **SDKs and APIs**. 

- Emphasizes **modularity**, **security**, and **scalability** for future expansion.
